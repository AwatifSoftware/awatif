## Getting started

You can either use the hosted version at https://app.awatif.co or run it locally by following these steps:

1.  Make sure you have downloaded and installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2.  Run the following commands in the terminal:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/madil4/awatif.git
cd awatif
npm install
npm run dev
```

The local development server will start, and the app will open in the browser. Make sure you read the documentation at [https://awatif.co/docs](https://mohamedadil.notion.site/Getting-Started-a8565ccbdea641b7b4793a6f42d983af) to understand the app.
