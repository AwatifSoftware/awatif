### What is Awatif?

Awatif is a platform designed to assist you in building web-based structural engineering apps, like the ones shown in the [Examples](https://awatif.co/examples/).

### Why use Awatif?

Automate tedious engineering processes through parametric modeling, facilitate collaboration with web user interfaces, and optimize designs using optimization techniques.

### Why it is different?

Awatif sets itself apart from other platforms, such as Grasshopper or Python, by employing a unique, simple data structure that seamlessly connects the modeling, analysis, design, report, and drawing phases in a parametric manner. While this parametric workflow may sound familiar if you've used Grasshopper with Karamba3D or Python with ETABS APIs, Awatif simplifies the process by consolidating everything into a single, interactive, scalable, and easy-to-develop platform. Moreover, Awatif is built for the web using TypeScript, allowing you to share your app with just a link. Additionally, Awatif offers the benefits of web platforms, such as offloading heavy calculations to servers and facilitating communication with different platforms like Python or C# through API calls.

### In summary, Awatif provides:

- 🔄 A unique and simple data structure for seamlessly linking various design algorithms and parametric scripts.
- 🌐 An open-source visualization tool that enables you to build your app in a 3D space, rendering bending moment diagrams and structural engineering reports—all within the browser.
- 💸 An affordable FEM library that offers real-time simulation for any structure, priced at only $25/month, easily integrable into your app.
- 📚 Open-source design libraries, allowing you to select the local-standard design code of your choice, complete with well-validated scripts and reports.
- 🛒 A Marketplace for those who prefer a non-programming approach, providing a variety of free and paid apps.
- 👥 A robust community of passionate structural engineers and developers ready to assist you in achieving your vision. Feel free to PM [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madil4/) to introduce you to the community.
